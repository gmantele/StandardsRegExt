To figure out the the extent of the problem with mixed-case standard
keys, I wanted to know all standard keys out there.  Here is a hack to
do that if you have a local connection to a DaCHS rr RegTAP
implementation:

psql gavo
\copy (select string_agg(oaixml, '') from rr.oairecs where ivoid like 'ivo://ivoa.net%') to ivorecs.xml;

Exit, psql, edit ivorecs.xml and give it an arbitrary root element.
Also replace the literal "\n".

Then:

xmlstarlet sel -t -c //key/name ivorecs.xml

Don't worry about the undefined namespace prefixes -- we don't need them
here.

With a bit of RE trickery, you'll get a list of standard keys.  In July
2023, we had:
